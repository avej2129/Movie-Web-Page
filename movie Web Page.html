                In 2019, the Indian Government revokes Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which grants special
                status for
                Jammu and Kashmir. The news impacts a cancer-ridden Pakistani army general Qadir, who decides to exact
                vengeance
                against India and signs a contract with Jim, who leads "Outfit X", a private terrorist organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Pathaan is a RAW agent, who along with his senior officer Nandini Grewal open a unit dubbed
                "Joint
                Operations and Covert Research" (JOCR) in order to recruit former RAW agents who were forced to retire
                due to
                past trauma or injury, but want to continue serving the country. With RAW joint secretary, Colonel Sunil
                Luthra's
                acceptance, Pathaan and his team head to Dubai to stop Outfit X's suspected plans of attacking the
                President of
                India at a scientific conference. However, they realize that their actual plan was to kidnap two
                scientists Dr.
                Farooqui and Dr. Sahani and the information they received about the imminent attack on the President was
                just a
                ruseto mislead them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jim attacks the scientists' convoy and Pathaan tries to stop him. A fight ensues, where Jim manages to
                escape
                withDr. Sahani. At the debrief back at the agency, Luthra reveals that Jim was a former RAW agent, who
                was awarded
                withthe Vir Puraskar for his bravery after the agency could not find his body when Somalian terrorists
                killed his
                wifeand unborn child after the government refused to pay out the ransom demanded. He had apparently
                faked his death
                inorder to seek vengeance against the agency and country for not saving his family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Pathaan learns about the codeword dubbed "Raktbeej" and also that the dead people in Dubai
                were
                ex-agents and their money was transferred from the account of Rubina Mohsin (Rubai), a Pakistani doctor
                in Spain. Pathaan
                travels to Spain and is captured by Jim's men, where he also learns that Rubai is an ex-ISI agent. When
                Jim
                leaves his hideout, Rubai attacks Jim's men and escapes with Pathaan. Rubai reveals that Raktbeej is in
                Moscow, where
                they travel to steal it before Jim does. However, Rubai betrays Pathaan and has him captured by the
                Russian police.
                It is revealed that Jim used Rubai to make Pathaan steal the Raktbeej for himself. Pathaan is captured
                and taken to
                prison by train, but is saved by Avinash Singh "Tiger" Rathore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three years later, Pathaan travels to Africa and captures Jim's henchman Raafe. He meets Nandini and
                reveals
                about Jim purchasing two saber missiles, while Nandini reveals Rubai's location in Paris. Pathaan meets
                Rubai, who
                reveals that the Raktbeej is a mutated smallpox virus, which was forcibly developed by a captive Dr.
                Sahani under Jim's
                orders. She also expresses guilt about betraying Pathaan without knowing that her country would plan
                such a heinous
                attack. They travel to Jim's lab in Siberia and manage to recover one orb containing the virus with
                great
                difficulty, while Jim escapes with the other orb. Luthra and Nandini reach Jim's lab to take the orb
                back to
                Indiain order to develop a vaccine. Luthra also has Rubai arrested for having questionable loyalties.

            The soundtrack album for Pathaan was composed by Vishal-Shekhar, lyrics by Kumaar for the two songs

            Balhara, two of their score pieces "Jim's Theme" and "Pathaan's Theme" were released with the soundtrack
            album by YRF Music on 22 December 2022.[54] Apart from its original, the soundtrack album was released in
            Tamil and Telugu.[55]

            Both the tracks – "Besharam Rang" and "Jhoome Jo Pathaan" – were conceptualized in a 'old-school'
            method,[56] the latter a modern qawwali.[57] "Besharam Rang" was the only Bollywood track of 2022 to gather
            100 million views on YouTube in the least number of days (five days).[58] Upon its release, "Jhoome Jo
            Pathaan" crossed 5.1 million views and 738K likes on YouTube within four hours of release.[59] Also, the
            song received 1 million views in less than 30 minutes after it was released.[60] The song also received more

            Right-wing Hindutva groups alleged that the song "Besharam Rang" promotes obscenity and that it disrespects
            the saffron colour as Padukone features in a saffron bikini in the song.[63] Madhya Pradesh home minister
            Narottam Mishra called the song objectionable and warned that his government may consider banning the film
            if costumes in the song are not corrected.[64] Khan's effigies and posters were burnt in various cities of
            Madhya Pradesh as a symbol of protest against the film.[65] TV actor Mukesh Khanna questioned the Censor
            Board for passing the song despite obscenity.[66] The News Minute termed the entire controversy as
            "shameless misreading for jingoism" and stated that there were five different costumes worn by Padukone in
            the song and the boycotters are criticizing this particular scene which features merely for 20 seconds as it
            suits their agenda.[67] A Muslim organization also objected to the song.[68]
        </p>
        <p>
            On 29 December 2022, the Central Board of Film Certification asked the filmmakers to make some changes in
            the film, including in its songs citing culture and faith.[69] The film went through some minor changes
            though the saffron dress scene in the song "Besharam Rang" was reportedly retained.[70] Pathaan was later
            granted a U/A certificate by the Board.[71]
        </p>

            On 4 January 2023, members of Bajrang Dal tore down the posters of the film at an Ahmedabad mall. They also
            warned them to not release the film in theatres.[72] Gujarat Multiplex Association wrote a letter to Chief
            Minister Bhupendra Patel and Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi on the threats received by the theater owners in
            Gujarat from various groups. Sanghavi assured protection to multiplexes on the release of the film and
            instructed police chiefs of cities and districts to provide protection to the theatres.[73]

        <p>
            On 17 January 2023, during the BJP national executive meeting in New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi
            told his party workers and leaders to refrain from making unnecessary remarks on films.[74][75] Despite
            this, Bajrang Dal activists tore down posters of the film and set them on fire at a cinema hall which was
            about to screen the movie in Guwahati. Assam's CM Himanta Biswa Sarma assured Shah Rukh Khan that his
            government would maintain the law and order in the state.[76]

            Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and termed the film a "complete
            entertainer replete with action, emotions, patriotism, humour, thrill, and of course, the star power of Shah
            Rukh Khan".[96] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Shah Rukh
            Khan's weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit lends Pathaan's all-out, devil-may-care
            antics a sense of purpose that evades mindless acts of mayhem".[97] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare rated the film
            4 out of 5 stars and called it a "visual spectacle" while also opining that the action choreography was
            "truly out of this world".[98] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and said, "Pathaan
            swings and strikes with all the style and aplomb in the world. It will be a hard act to follow".[99] Renuka
            Vyavahare of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Pathaan has all the
            ingredients of a masala potboiler — slowmo entries, iconic battle of good versus bad and most importantly a
            sexy-smouldering Shah Rukh Khan, who can fight the good fight on and off the screen".[100] Tanisha Bagchi of
            The Quint gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, "If Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff's showdown
            in War kept you on the edge of your seats, Shah Rukh and John's fistfights and blows are nothing short of
            whistle-worthy".[101] Abhimanyu Mathur of DNA India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and praised the
            performances and score but termed some of the action scenes as "over-the-top and unbelievable".[102]
            Ritika Handoo of Zee News rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and mentioned, "There is not even a single dull
            moment in this YRF actioner. The action sequences between SRK and John are over-the-top yet
            mind-numbing".[103] Tushar Joshi of
        
            india Today rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, "Shah Rukh is the heart of Pathaan".[104] Pooja Biraia
            Jaiswal of The Week rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Pathaan is a dishoom-dishoom joy ride
            between Khan and his perfectly beefed-up antagonist Abraham. The intention is not to let the narrative drive
            the story forward, but to let the larger-than-life magic of its lead superstars cast its spell".[105]
            Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and opined that it has "finally cracked
            the requirements of an action movie — non-stop action, leavened by glamorous leads, topped by the guy who
            can save the world, a high-octane set piece and an emo line at a time".[106] Anna M. M. Vetticad of
            Firstpost rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote, "Pathaan is so much fun when it's being fun especially with
            a smashing Salman Khan cameo – that it is tempting to overlook its play-it-safe politics".[107]
         <p>
            Sajesh Mohan of Onmanorama stated that "Siddharth Anand's Pathaan lays out a perfect red-carpet entry for
            Shah Rukh Khan into the YRF Spy Universe with its right formula of high-octane death and logic-defying
            action sequences seasoned with desh bhakti (patriotism) and qurbani (sacrifice)."[108] Monika Rawal Kukreja
            of Hindustan Times stated, "Pathaan is your true-blue commercial, masala entertainer that's not trying to
            send across any message or be a social commentary on the current state of affairs in the country. It's fun,
            non-fussy and fantastic at the same time".[109] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote, "The film's greatest
            blaster is its hero itself, parleying his well-oiled impishness, time-tested charm and mesmeric screen
            presence for a cheesy but also entertaining save-the-nation exercise".[110]

            International
            Cath Clarke of The Guardian rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, "This enjoyable high-octane action
            spy movie from India is possibly the most fun you can currently have at the cinema. Still, the cheers kept
            coming; the loudest whoop of all when Salman Khan made an entrance as Tiger, a hero from an earlier movie in
            the series".[111] Conversely, Simon Abrams of TheWrap dismissed it as "an amateurish Indian super-spy
            thriller that's never as well-executed as it is conceptually goofy and politically dubious".[112] Owen
            Gleiberman of Variety was similarly not impressed, terming the film a "a sprawling, mountainous tangle of
            pulp that stacks one genre on top of the next with an arbitrary verve", but picked up the "iconic quality of
            its stars" Khan and Abraham for praise.[113] Timon Singh of Empire summarised, "Pathaan delivers everything
            that an Indian blockbuster should: a guaranteed box office draw with Khan, exotic locales, crowd-pleasing
            cameos, stunning dance numbers and gravity-defying stunts that make the Fast and Furious franchise look
            restrained."[114]

            crore (US$25 million) and ₹300 crore (US$38 million), which it did within four and seven days,

            became the highest-grossing Hindi film in the market in its opening weekend itself.[18] Box Office India
            reported that by grossing around US$31 million in its first eight days, it became the highest-grossing Hindi
